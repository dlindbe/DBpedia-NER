DBPEDIA-NER
======================

Description
-----------

This code was written to invetigate the feasibility of leveraging DBpedia to 
do named entity recognition, a task that more typically requires expensive statistical models.

The DBpediaNERTestDriver class can be used to feed test sentences into the DBpediaNER class, 
whose getAnnotationTable() method takes an input sentence and returns a 2D array of 
[word/phrase, named entity type] pairs.

Running a demo
--------------
A pre-compiled jar file and the needed libraries can be found in the 'dist' folder.

Known limitations
-----------------

The runtime performance very much depends on the stability of the dbpedia.org SPARQL endpoint. If
dbpedia is down or experiencing difficulties, this tool will not work or will be extremely slow.

The current version looks only at noun phrases. It does not look specifically at proper nouns embedded in 
longer phrases. Adding this feature elegantly will require some refactoring and will appear in the 
next version.
